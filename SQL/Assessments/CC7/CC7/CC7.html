        Dihydrogen Monoxide
        <p> <b><i>hydroxyl acid</i></b><sup>1</sup> <b><i>or DHMO</i></b><sup>2</sup> is a dangerous
    </h1> </p>
    <p>
        <b>substance that<sup>2</sup>:</b> is the major component of acid rain, contributes to the greenhouse effect, may<br>
        cause severe burns, is fatal if inhaled, contributes to the erosion of our natural landscape,<br>
        accelerates corrosion and rusting of many metals, may cause electrical failures and decreased<br>
        effectiveness of automobile brakes, and has been found in excised tumors of terminal cancer<br>
        patients. Despite the danger, DHMO is often used: as an industrial solvent and coolant, in nuclear<br>
        power plants in the production of Styrofoam<sup>TM</sup>, as a fire retardant, in many forms of cruel animal<br>
        research, as an additive in certain junk-foods and other food products, in the distribution of<br>
        pesticides. Even after washing, produce remains contaminated by this chemical.
